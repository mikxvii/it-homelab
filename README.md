# IT Home Lab
## Overview
Brief description of the project — what you built and why.
## Project 1: Windows Server & Active Directory

Environment: Windows Server 2025 on Azure
Domain: mike.local
What you configured: OUs, user accounts, GPOs, shared folders, security groups

## Active Directory Structure
Document your OUs (Engineering, HR, Finance) and the users you created in each.
## Group Policy Objects
Document your Security Policy GPO — password complexity settings, screen lock at 600 seconds.
## IT Tasks Simulated

Disabled/re-enabled user accounts
Password resets with forced change at next logon
Security group membership management
Shared folder with permission-based access

## Network Diagram
For now just note that you'll add a diagram here — we'll create one using draw.io after.
